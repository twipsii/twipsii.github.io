For the homework we had to read a quite comprehensive and informative chapter about p values, null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and confidence intervals (CI). It explains the basic concepts very well and I added some of them to my library. These will come in handy when I need to refresh my mind on basic statistics.

The following graphic shows how we can translate between p values and 95% CIs by eyeballing:

The reading also mentions four red flags that everyone should take into account when reading about p values or NHST. Those are:

1. Beware dichotomous conclusions, which may give a false sense of certainty. Prefer estimation thinking. Express research aims as “how much” or “to what extent” questions.
2. Beware the dangerously ambiguous S word. Say “statistically significant”, or use a different word. Beware the slippery slope of significance.
3. A large *p* value provides no evidence that the null hypothesis is true. Beware accepting the null hypothesis. Beware the slippery slope of nonsignificance.
4. Beware any suggestion that the *p* value is the probability that H<sub>0/sub> is true. In other words, the *p* value is *not* the probability that our results are due to chance.
