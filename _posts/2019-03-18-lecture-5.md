title: Lecture 5 - Re-structuring the library
comments: true
---

My data analysis library didn't grow this week. I changed some of last week's code on *ggplot2* to make it look a bit cleaner. I can imagine having a set of Rmd files can make me lose the overview quickly as the library grows. Therefore, I want to bring in more structure to the files, e.g. by having a clear naming convention.

This semester, I'm enrolled in another course where we are looking at quantitative methods using R. However, it's in a completely different field, linguistics. But I'm sure there are similar approaches and I might enhance my library with code/information from that course.
