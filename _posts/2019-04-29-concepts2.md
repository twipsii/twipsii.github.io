This week's lecture covered part two of concepts in statistics. We looked at how to analyse linear models, interaction effects and what follow-up tests we can perform after the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

In another class that I mentioned in a previous blog post, we looked at Bayesian statistics which infers probability distributions over parameters and even hypotheses. Bayesian statistics asks different questions from frequentist statistics:

- Frequentist statistics: Are these coefficients significant?
- Bayesian statistics: What is the distribution over coefficients?

The Bayesian framework seems also interesting and I started to create a section about it in my library.
