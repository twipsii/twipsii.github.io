title: Lecture 3 - First post and linear models

Dear reader, this is my first blog post describing the creation of my data analysis reference library in the course of the module **Quantitative Methods in Human-Computer Interaction** attended in the spring semester 2019. Future posts - which are hopefully created on a weekly basis - will cover additions to said library and describe how I was able to use its contents as a reference for my data analysis work.

**Creation and design**

For the format of my library, I decided to build up a collection of R Markdown files. I am planning to create one file for each major topic we deal with in the lecture. These files can be easily read in my preferred R tool: **RStudio**. The content and codes can be executed directly within RStudio. You can read more about the file format here: [R for Data Science - Chapter 27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)

**Linear models**

Today we looked at how to formulate a linear model in R. Linear models are used to analyze the effect of categorical IVs to interval DVs. The general concept looks as follows:

```
Model function | Function in R
--- | ---
One IV | lm(DV ~ IV, data = dataset)
Two IVs | lm(DV ~ IV1 + IV2, data = dataset)
Two IVs with interaction | lm(DV ~ IV1 * IV2, data = dataset)
Two IVs, interaction, within-subjects design | lmer(DV ~ (1|participant) + IV1 * IV , data = dataset)
```

Linear models are the first major topic in my data analysis library.
