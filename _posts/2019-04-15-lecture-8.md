In this week's lecture we looked at basic concepts in statistics. This included descriptive as well as inferential statistics. The *p*-value indicates how incompatible the data is wit the null hypothesis. However, interval estimates like the 95% CI are more informative than the p-value and therefore the preferred value in experiments. Conclusion: **Don't trust p!**

There's an informative video we watched during the lecture:

I added a section about descriptive statistics to my library where I try to cover basic functions like these:

- Mean: `mean()`
- Median: `median()`
- Interquartile range: `IQR()`

Or a neat function from the lecture to get the mode:

```r
find_modes <- function(x){
    xtab <- table(x)
    if (max(xtab) == 1) {
        return("") # no duplicate data points
    }
    modes <- xtab[max(xtab) == xtab]
    themodes <- names(modes)
    mode(themodes) <- typeof(x[1])
    mode_out <- paste(themodes, sep = ", ")
    return(mode_out)
}
```
