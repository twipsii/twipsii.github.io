title: Lecture 8 - Basic concepts in statistics
comments: true
---

In this week's lecture we looked at basic concepts in statistics. This included descriptive as well as inferential statistics. The *p*-value indicates how incompatible the data is wit the null hypothesis. However, interval estimates like the 95% CI are more informative than the p-value and therefore the preferred value in experiments. Conclusion: **Don't trust p!**

There's an informative video we watched during the lecture:
