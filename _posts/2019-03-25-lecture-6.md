This week I was able to use my library, especially the *ggplot2* part, for an exercise on signal processing we had to do in another course. The goal was to calculate and visualise the output of different functions on two input signals, e.g. cross-correlation or convolution. This is an example code I wrote in R:

```r
ggplot(matrix, aes(X, cross_cor_A_B)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
  geom_segment(aes(xend=X, yend=0), color = "blue") + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("A[n] cross-correlation B[n]") + 
  labs(x="Time units", y="Amplitude") +
  scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = X, breaks = X) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(min(cross_cor_A_B), max(cross_cor_A_B), by=2))
```

And it generated the following graph of the cross-correlation (given the variables are defined...):

![Cross-correlation](../../../data/images/cross_correlation.png "Cross-correlation of the input signals A[n] and B[n]")

**R4DS Chapter 14: Strings**

String manipulation is always an important topic in programming languages, and R is no exception in this. The cool thing in R is that you can store multiple strings in a character vector `c()` and process all items in the vector with a single function, like so:

```r
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
```
*> [1] "App" "Ban" "Pea"*

`str_sub()` extracts parts of a string using *start* and *end* arguments representing the positions of the string.

Pattern matching with **regular expressions** is another important topic when it comes to string manipulation. I've dealt with regexps before and I'm already familiar with most of the concepts described in this chapter. However, here are some new insights which I'll include in my library:

`$` `.` `|` `?` `*` `+` `(` `)` `[` `{` 

The above symbols can be used in a character class `[  ]` without having to escape them individually with a backslash.

However, this doesn't work for these characters: `]` `\` `^` `-`.
