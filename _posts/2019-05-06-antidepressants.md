*Do antidepressants really work?* - This is the leading question of an episode of Science VS's podcast from 2016 that we had to listen to as part of the homework in the week without a lecture.

Here's the link to the podcast: [Antidepressants](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/5whmld/antidepressants "Antidepressants podcast by Science VS")

It's highly debatable whether antidepressants are more useful for people suffering of depression than a sugar pill, also known as placebo. Depression is measured by the Hamilton scale which was originally published in 1960. It is a multiple item questionnaire where the patient is rated by a clinician on a 3-point or 5-point Likert-type scale. Antidepressants are getting released based on achieving a certain higher level on the Hamilton scale compared to a placebo, i.e. the better score is "statistically significant". However, it is still not clear if that's enough to guarantee a positive effect of the antidepressant.

There are no updates regarding my data analysis library.
